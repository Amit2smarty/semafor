SEMAFOR: Semantic Analysis of Frame Representations
===================================================

SEMAFOR is a tool for automatic analysis of the frame-semantic structure of English text.

[FrameNet](<http://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu>) is a lexical resource that groups predicates in a hierarchy of structured
concepts, known as *frames*. Each frame in the lexicon in turn defines several named *roles* corresponding to aspects of
that concept (e.g. participants in an event).

This tool attempts to find which words in text evoke which semantic frames, and to find and label each frame's
*arguments* - portions of the sentence that fill a role associated with the frame. It takes as input a file with English
sentences, one per line, and performs the following steps:

  0. Preprocessing
     The sentences are lemmatized, part-of-speech tagged, and syntactically parsed (optionally using a syntactic parsing
     running in server mode.)

  1. Target identification
     Frame-evoking words and phrases ("targets") are heuristically identified in each sentence.

  2. Frame identification
     A log-linear model, trained on FrameNet 1.5 data with full-text frame annotations, produces for each target a
     probability distribution over frames in the FrameNet lexicon (optionally constrained by a semi-supervised filter).
     The target is then labeled with the highest-scoring frame.

  3. Argument identification
     A second log-linear model, trained on the same data, considers every role of each labeled frame instance and
     identifies a span of words in the sentence - or NULL - as filling that role. A subsequent step ensures that none of
     a frame's overt arguments overlap using beam search; an alternate strategy using AD^3 (or Alternating Directions
     Dual Decomposition) uses two other constraints used in FrameNet for argument identification.

  4. Output
     An XML or JSON file is produced containing the text of the input sentences, augmented with the frame-semantic
     information (target-frame and argument-role pairings) predicted by the system. See the papers listed below
     ("Further Reading") for algorithmic details and experimental evaluation of the components of this system.

What follows is an overview of the organization of SEMAFOR's directory structure, and how it can be installed and run on
new data.

Installation
============

Downloads
---------

This experimental fork is maintained at <https://github.com/sammthomson/semafor>.
For a more stable version, the latest official release, SEMAFOR v2.1, can be downloaded from
<http://semafor-semantic-parser.googlecode.com/files/SEMAFOR-2.1.tgz>

In preprocessing, SEMAFOR uses a syntactic dependency parser - either MaltParser or MSTParser.
The main difference is that Malt is faster and requires much less memory. They make different types of errors, but
performance is about the same. I (Sam) usually run the Malt version.

To use MaltParser, download and unpack the model files for MaltParser and SEMAFOR from here:
<http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/SEMAFOR/semafor_malt_model_20121129.tar.gz> (~140MB).
The model file for the MaltParser was trained on sections 02-21 of the WSJ section of the Penn Treebank, and the model
files for SEMAFOR were trained on the FrameNet 1.5 datasets.

To use MSTParser, download and unpack the following packaged version:
<http://semafor-semantic-parser.googlecode.com/files/stackedParserServer.tgz>.
The original MST parser has been modified to add an option of running it in server mode, for ease of use.

Download the model files both for the MST parser and SEMAFOR from here:
<http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/SEMAFOR/SEMAFOR-2.1-models.tgz> (~400MB).
The model file for the MST parser was trained on sections 02-21 of the WSJ section of the Penn Treebank, and the model
files for SEMAFOR were trained on the FrameNet 1.5 datasets.

Note that the SEMAFOR models themselves are different, not just the dependency parsing models.


Environment Variables
---------------------

The file `bin/config.sh` lists a set of variables which should be modified within the file before running
SEMAFOR:

- `SEMAFOR_HOME`: absolute path where the repository has been cloned.

- `MALT_MODEL_DIR`: the absolute path where the Malt models have been decompressed.

- `MST_MODEL_DIR`: the absolute path where the MST models have been decompressed.

- `TMPDIR`: absolute path to a temporary directory for SEMAFOR to use.

- `MST_MODE`: the provided MST parser package can now run in `server` or `noserver` modes; this variable should be set accordingly. When the parser is running on
server mode, SEMAFOR takes several minutes less to initialize its models; hence, it is a very advantageous mode given that one has a high memory machine on which
the MST parser can run.

- `MST_PARSER_HOME`: absolute path where stackedParserServer.tgz has been decompressed.

- `MST_MACHINE`: if MST parser is running on server mode, this variable should be set to the machine's name or IP address

- `MST_PORT`: the port at which the MST parser is running on `${MST_MACHINE}`.

- `JAVA_HOME_BIN`: the absolute path to the bin directory under which the executables javac and java can be found.
If the environment variable `${JAVA_HOME}` is set, `${JAVA_HOME_BIN}` should be `${JAVA_HOME}/bin`.

- `GOLD_TARGET_FILE`: the current version of SEMAFOR has a setting where input targets can be provided to it.
This is beneficial for users who are interested in a specific set of targets instead of all targets that SEMAFOR
identifies using inbuilt heuristics (the target identification stage of the pipeline).
To do this, this variable should be set to the absolute path of a file that contains space separated target spans for
each sentence, per line.
For best results, if an input target file is used, the user should provide tokenized sentences to SEMAFOR, because in
this mode, SEMAFOR does not run inbuilt tokenization.
If there is no input target file, this variable should be set to null.

- `AUTO_TARGET_ID_MODE`: SEMAFOR has two automatic target identification models: `strict` and `relaxed`. The
`strict` mode uses morphological variants of all the targets seen in the FrameNet 1.5 lexicon and its training data.
The `relaxed` mode labels all content words other than proper nouns as frame-evoking targets. Default is the `strict`
mode.

- `USE_GRAPH_FILE`: this should be set to `yes` or `no` depending on whether the user wants to used semi-supervised
constraints for frame identification (see Das and Smith, 2011, 2012). This flag does not matter much when strict target
identification is used. However, if the user uses an input target file and there are several targets which SEMAFOR did
not see during supervised training, then setting the value of this environment variable will yield better results.
The current release uses the better graph-based semi-supervised learning technique presented by Das and Smith (2012)
for the filter.

- `DECODING_TYPE`: this should be `beam` or `ad3` depending on whether the user wants fast inexact beam search that
prevents argument overlap
or AD^3, which is an exact dual decomposition algorithm that respects the overlap constraints, as well as two other
linguistic constraints.
For more details, see Das et al. (*SEM 2012).
I (Sam) usually run with beam search, as it's faster with roughly equal performance.


Compilation
-----------

Compilation is easiest using Maven (<http://maven.apache.org/>).

    mvn package

will compile and package Semafor-3.0-alpha-04.jar (including all dependencies) to the target/ directory.
Many scripts in bin/ point to Semafor-3.0-alpha-04.jar, so run `mvn package` immediately after installing, and again
after making any changes to source code.


Running the Frame-Semantic Parser
=================================

1. MaltParser
-------------

    ./bin/fnParserDriverMalt.sh <absolute-path-to-input-file-with-one-sentence-per-line> [<output-file>] [<output-format>]


2. MST
------

If the MST parser is to be run in server mode, in other words, if `MST_MODE=server`, then before running SEMAFOR,
the user should log on to the chosen server machine (`MST_MACHINE`), install SEMAFOR exactly as described above and run:

    ./bin/startMSTServer.sh

The message: `Waiting for Connection on Port: NNNNN` will appear once the server has loaded
the parsing model and is ready to accept connections (takes a few minutes). Here `NNNNN` is the value of the `MST_PORT`
variable.
After that, log on to the machine where you want to run SEMAFOR.

Run the following command to execute SEMAFOR.

    ./bin/fnParserDriverMst.sh <absolute-path-to-input-file-with-one-sentence-per-line> [<output-file>]

3. Server Mode
--------------

SEMAFOR can also be run as a TCP socket server.
It accepts dependency parses in conll format, and replies with json frame-semantic parses.
Run the following command

    java -Xms4g -Xmx4g -jar target/Semafor-3.0-alpha-04.jar model-dir:<directory-of-trained-model> port:<port>


The message: `Listening on port: NNNN` will appear once the server has loaded
the model and is ready to accept connections (where `NNNN` is the port).
You can test that it's working with the following:

    cat src/test/resources/fixtures/example.conll | nc localhost NNNN

(where `NNNN` is again the port).

5. Known Issues:
================

  - [x] Currently, SEMAFOR requires 8GB of RAM to execute because of its dependence on the MST parser,
which loads a large model trained on the English Penn Treebank.

    FIXED(sam): added a MaltParser option

  - [x] The output of SEMAFOR is an XML file. If there are several thousand sentences to be parsed
by SEMAFOR, then it becomes cumbersome to view the XML file. Modifying fnParserDriver.sh to
view raw text versions of SEMAFOR output is possible.

    FIXED(sam): added a one-per-line json output, and set Semafor to use it by default.

  - [ ] The `start` and `end` character offsets in the xml output correspond to offsets *after* tokenization, making them
    more or less useless.
    I (Sam) have added `tokenStart` and `tokenEnd` attributes and a `tokens` element to the xml output to hopefully
    facilitate a workaround.
    The `start` and `end` fields in the json output are token offsets.

7. Version History
==================

- 1.0 First public release (2010-04-26)

- 1.0.1 Second public release (2010-09-02)
     Now includes compiled Java .class files for SEMAFOR, so compiling from source is
     not necessary.

     Now includes the SemEval 2007 Task 19 dataset and evaluation resources (see
     README.txt in the SemEval2007/ directory for details).

     Bug fixes:
     1) Fixed an issue of tokenization with 'sed'. Now uses 'sed -f' explicitly
        instead of running the script as an executable.
     2) Included 'mkdir tmp' in the MST parser root directory. This is necessary
        for running the MST parser.
     3) At the top of the 'mxpost' script that does POS tagging, changed '#!/bin/ksh'
        to '#!/bin/bash' because the former did not run in some machines.

- 2.0 Third public release (2011-04-23)
    New features:
    1) Added server mode to the MST parser.
    2) Trained on newer, much larger dataset from FrameNet 1.5.
    3) Users can input their own targets file, suiting different domains and requirements.
    4) One class file does all the pipeline processing unlike the previous versions.
    5) The argument identification stage has been made much faster.
    6) Previous releases could not handle large set of sentences; that has been fixed.
    7) Added source to googlecode.com for open source development.
    8) Semi-supervised graph-based constraints have been added for frame identification.

- 2.1 Fourth public release (2012-05-22)
    New features:
    1) Beam width for beam search was reduced after noticing that it makes no difference empirically
       in FrameNet datasets. This made argument identification much faster. Current beam width=100.
    2) Added a new graph filter based on the NAACL 2012 paper by Das and Smith. This makes frame
       identification more accurate than before.
    3) Finally, added AD^3, a dual decomposition algorithm for argument identification. See Das et al.
       (*SEM 2012) for more details. Note that the results using the released code will not match
       the results reported in the *SEM paper, because of a new Java implementation different
       from the implementation used for the paper.
